\cf0 	For step 5, the input I provided was 100 for the number surveyed, 50 for the number who voted for Hillary, and 50 for the number who voted for Donald. After these integers were inputed the program gave me an output saying that Donald Trump is predicted to win the election, which does not make sense since the \'93poll\'94 clearly showed a tie between Hillary and Donald. The compiler itself reported no error message, but this is a nonsensical response. Another input I provided was 100 for the number surveyed, 12 for the number who voted for Hillary, and 10 for the number who voted for Donald. In response to these integers being inputed, the program gave me an output saying that Hillary Clinton is predicted to win the election, which again does not make sense since the majority of people are voting for someone who is not Clinton or Trump. Since this third party is receiving the majority of votes, he or she should be expected to win the election; this is another example of a nonsensical response.\
	For the logic_error program, I changed the way pctDonald was calculated from [forDonald / numberSurveyed] to [(numberSurveyed - forHillary) / numberSurveyed]. This calculation makes the assumption that everyone is either voting for Hillary or Donald and that no one is voting for any third party candidate. Thus even if you inputed 100 for the number surveyed, 50 for the number who voted for Hillary, and 30 for the number who voted for Donald, you would still get pctDonald was 50.0% and not 30.0%. This error, even though it does not prevent a successful build, leads to incorrect outputs.\
	For the compile_error program, I changed the type of the variables numberSurveyed, forHillary, and forDonald from int to string. This caused an error because when the program tried to divide the variables it was unable to since the variables were stored as the type string, and the specific error message it gave was \'93Invalid operands to binary expression\'94. The second error I introduced was change the else in the if function to else if. This broke the program because there were no parameters for the else if part, and the specific error message it gave was \'93Expected \'91(\'91 after \'91if\'94.}
